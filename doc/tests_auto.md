# Automated tests

Configure Labber by copying the configuration from `tests_config\AppData` to the corresponding directory.

Manually set SPS97656 and SPS03052 to run the tests.

You will find some reasoning for every test in `stimuli_src_micropython\scenario_xx*.py`.

You will find the reference results in `tests_config\Data\measurement_SPS03052.hdf5` and `tests_config\Data\measurement_SPS97656.hdf5`.
